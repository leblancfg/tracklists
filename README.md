 :arrow_forward: Little CLI program that makes skippable YouTube track lists out of duration-based ones

You've probably stumbled onto your share of YouTube albums that either didn't have a skippable tracklist, or worse yet, one that is based on track duration rather than total running time. This little CLI tool aims to remedy that problem by reading in what's in your clipboard -- regardless of platform! -- and spitting out a proper tracklist.

    * copy a duration-based track list to clipboard *
    $ python tracklist.py
    * print out abeautiful, skippable tracklist *
